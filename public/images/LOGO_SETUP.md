# üé® Kiddoo Preschool Logo Setup

## ‚úÖ What's Already Done

The navbar has been configured to display your Kiddoo logo alongside the colorful "KIDDOO PRESCHOOL" text.

## üì∏ How to Add Your Actual Logo

### Option 1: Replace the SVG (Recommended)

1. **Save your Kiddoo logo** from the image you provided
2. **Name it:** `kiddoo-logo.png` or `kiddoo-logo.svg`
3. **Place it in:** `frontend/public/images/`
4. The navbar will automatically use it!

### Option 2: Manual Copy

If you have the logo file:

```bash
# Navigate to the images folder
cd frontend/public/images/

# Copy your logo file here and rename it
# Make sure it's named either:
# - kiddoo-logo.svg (preferred)
# - kiddoo-logo.png (fallback)
```

## üéØ Logo Specifications

Based on your provided logo design:

- **Primary File:** `kiddoo-logo.svg` (will be tried first)
- **Fallback File:** `kiddoo-logo.png` (if SVG not available)
- **Display Size:** 70px height (auto-scales)
- **Format:** PNG or SVG with transparent background
- **Recommended Size:** 200x200 pixels minimum

## üñºÔ∏è Your Logo Design

Your logo features:
- Colorful child face illustration
- Yellow star, red dot, and colorful decorative arcs
- "KIDDOO" in multi-color letters (Blue, Yellow, Red, Green, Orange, Blue)
- "PRESCHOOL" text below
- "BY AARYA INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL" subtitle

## üìã Current Navbar Layout

```
[Logo Image] + KIDDOO (gradient text)
               PRESCHOOL
               BY AARYA INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL
```

## üîÑ Fallback Behavior

The navbar has smart fallback:
1. Tries to load `kiddoo-logo.svg` first
2. If that fails, tries `kiddoo-logo.png`
3. If both fail, shows a child icon (FaChild)

## ‚ú® Temporary Logo

A placeholder SVG logo has been created at:
`frontend/public/images/kiddoo-logo.svg`

**Replace this with your actual logo** for the best results!

## üöÄ Testing

After adding your logo:

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. Open `http://localhost:3000`
3. Check if the logo appears in the navbar
4. Logo should appear next to "KIDDOO PRESCHOOL" text

## üí° Tips

- **SVG is preferred** for crisp display on all screen sizes
- **PNG should have transparent background** for best appearance
- **Logo will auto-scale** to 70px height while maintaining aspect ratio
- Logo appears on **all pages** (sticky navbar)

## üìß Need Help?

If the logo doesn't appear:
1. Check the file name is exactly `kiddoo-logo.svg` or `kiddoo-logo.png`
2. Verify it's in `frontend/public/images/` folder
3. Refresh the browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Check browser console for any errors
