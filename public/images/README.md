# Logo Instructions

## How to Add Kiddoo Preschool Logo

1. Save your Kiddoo Preschool logo image as `kiddoo-logo.png` in this directory (`frontend/public/images/`)

2. The logo should be:
   - PNG format with transparent background (preferred)
   - Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or similar aspect ratio
   - High quality for crisp display on all devices

3. The navbar will automatically display your logo once the file is added

## Logo Specifications

- **File Name:** `kiddoo-logo.png`
- **Location:** `frontend/public/images/kiddoo-logo.png`
- **Format:** PNG (with transparency) or JPG
- **Dimensions:** 200x200px recommended (will auto-scale to 50px height)

## Current Logo Reference

The logo design should match the Kiddoo Preschool branding:
- Colorful child face with decorative elements (stars, shapes)
- "KIDDOO" text in multi-color letters (Blue, Yellow, Red, Green, Orange, Blue)
- "PRESCHOOL" text below
- "BY AARYA INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL" subtitle

If the logo file is not found, the navbar will fallback to a default icon.
